# Title

## Objective / Purpose<br>

The purpose of this lab is to design a LCD driver.  However, this driver should be a relative port from the assembly code written from Lab03.  Clean, modular, and maintanable C code is a strong emphasis to focus on when designing the API for the LCD driver code.<br>

## Preliminary Design<br>
Porting the assembly code over to C should be relatively simple, further explanation on this process to come when I start attempting it.<br>
<br>
Software delays in C on the MSP430 should be simple using the code provided by the instructor.  By using the C macro __delay_cycles(num_of_cycles), I should be able to use the exact number of cycles I calculated in lab03 with no side effects.<br>
